# Part-of-Speech Tagging 

Part-of-Speech Tagging (POS Tagging) is the process of marking up a word in a text (corpus) as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition and its context. In this project we used the [Pomegranate](https://github.com/jmschrei/pomegranate) library to build a hidden Markov model for part of speech tagging with a [universal tagset](http://www.petrovi.de/data/universal.pdf) that has been able to achieve >97% tag accuracy.

## Descriptions
 
This model takes an input any sentence or sequence of words and outputs a tag of 12 different tags ('VERB','NOUN','ADV',...) for each word based based on both its definition and its context.
