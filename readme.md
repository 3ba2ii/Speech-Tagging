# Part-of-Speech Tagging 

Part-of-Speech Tagging ```POS Tagging``` is the process of marking up a word in a text ```corpus``` as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition and its context. In this project we developed a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to build the

## Description
 
This model takes an input any sentence or sequence of words and pre-process it before passing it to the HMM then outputs a probability of each word to what tag on it outputs a tag of 12 different tags ('VERB','NOUN','ADV',...) for each word based on both its definition and its context.

## Dataset 

In this project we used the [Pomegranate](https://github.com/jmschrei/pomegranate) library to build a hidden Markov model for part of speech tagging with a [universal tagset](http://www.petrovi.de/data/universal.pdf).
